We hope you have a great time being a part of this amazing community. To help you get started on your journey, we've made this tutorial on Deadline's chat/RP commands, dice mechanics and a brief overview of Merchant Island.",
	SurvivalGuide_BS2Entry1Title = "Do's and Don'ts",
	SurvivalGuide_BS2Entry1txt = "<CENTRE> <SIZE:large> Do's and Don'ts <LINE> <SIZE:medium> <LEFT> Don't spam OOC, keep it brief. <LINE> Don't drop trash on the floor. <LINE> Do right click trash and select 'Trash Item' <LINE> Don't destroy or remove tiles you want to take for yourself. <LINE> Do make a ticket to request a copy of the tile. <LINE> Don't break down vehicles to scrap them. <BR> Do ask for help in Discord: #Questions and #Character-Plans. <LINE> Do tune your radio to 100MHz to talk with other survivors.",
	SurvivalGuide_BS3Entry1Title = "RP Commands",
	SurvivalGuide_BS3Entry1txt = "<CENTRE> <SIZE:large> RP Commands - Page 1 <LINE> <SIZE:medium> <LEFT> You'll be using the chat box to roleplay with others. The first thing you should do is type /name to set the way you'd like your name to look to others. This can be your first name, last name or a nickname. <BR> This is also a great time to set up your character's bio. Right click near your character's feet and select "Edit Character". There you can fill out a quick bio, list your RP preferences and add a description.",
	SurvivalGuide_BS3Entry2txt = "<CENTRE> <SIZE:large> RP Commands - Page 2 <LINE> <SIZE:medium> <LEFT> You can always bring up chat by typing enter. Tab will allow you to switch between General chat (what's happening around you in character) and OOC (Out of Character chat). Please keep OOC chat for only essentials. <BR> Above the tabs are buttons you can use to learn more. The Area button shows you the range in tiles of whisper, low, say, loud and shout speech and emotes. Take the time to check it out now.",
	SurvivalGuide_BS3Entry3txt = "<CENTRE> <SIZE:large> RP Commands - Page 3 <LINE> <SIZE:medium> <LEFT> The Cogwheel will allow you to do a lot of cool stuff like change your name color in chat or use different languages if your character knows them. You can also make the chat window opaque which can help with driving. <BR> The easiest way to learn about chat commands though is to try them. Before heading out, you may want to try /me waves to you. Or /shout Hello! and get the hang off them.",
	SurvivalGuide_BS3Entry4txt = "<CENTRE> <SIZE:large> RP Commands - Page 4 <LINE> <SIZE:medium> <LEFT> You can even use chat emotes and speech at the same time by using quotations inside a regular emote. <LINE> Try /me waves at you, 'Hello!' <BR>  Check out the full list by going to the Cogwheel > Actions > List RP Chat Commands. You can also use /afk to show other players you've stepped away but while the tutorial zone is safe, this won't protect you from the zombies out there!",
	SurvivalGuide_BS4Entry1Title = "Using Dice",
	SurvivalGuide_BS4Entry1txt = "<CENTRE> <SIZE:large> Using Dice - Page 1 <LINE> <SIZE:medium> <LEFT> Dice are the lifeblood of an RPG. They determine success or failure for many actions - player initiated or when called on by a Storyteller. A few examples are: <LINE> You can Hide an object from another player. <LINE> You can suffer from a low Mental Endurance during a stressful interaction. <LINE> And of course you can Attack (or Defend) in a PVP encounter.",
	SurvivalGuide_BS4Entry2txt = "<CENTRE> <SIZE:large> Using Dice - Page 2 <LINE> <SIZE:medium> <LEFT> We have a guide on dice on the Discord, but to familiarize you quickly, click on the “Client” button at the bottom of your left hand icons. This brings up another menu and you can click on Deadline Dice. You will see a hit point tracker at the top, a 20 sided die for Initiative, and a list of skills to the bottom. <BR> When called for, just click on the appropriate skills or the die itself if you need to roll initiative. The roll will spit out the result to the chat for everyone to see - so there is no need to ask what someone got. Additionally, you can also use a command to roll dice. /roll followed by the dice and number you want to roll is supported for any kind of dice of any amount. /roll 1d20 is for a 20 sided dice. /roll 5d6 will roll 5 six sided dice.

	SurvivalGuide_BS5Entry1txt = "<CENTRE> <SIZE:large> Finalize Your Character <LINE> <SIZE:medium> <LEFT> The last step before you set out into the crazy, beautiful and immense world of Merchant Island is to check over your build one last time. <LINE> Once you leave the tutorial zone, you are locked in to the traits and occupation that you have chosen - there is no coming back here. <LINE> Take all the time that you need. Look over the rules again in Discord if there is anything you aren't clear on. If you are ready, then use the deployment terminal and begin your adventure in Merchant Island.",
