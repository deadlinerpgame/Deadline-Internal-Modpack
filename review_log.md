# Mod Review Log â€“ local-dev branch

This log documents the audit and verification of each mod in `local-dev` against `steam_release`.

---

### DL_CraftingEnhancedCore

- Reviewed against the following versions: `steam_release`, `20-change-smithing-components-to-their-own-category`, `main`, `23-cookline`, `15-prostheticsline`,`QueueLine`,`AerxBranch`,`logline` and `dev`
- **Result:** Identical content except for `mod.info`.
- **Difference:**
  - `name=` and `id=` were renamed in `local-dev` to use new naming convention (`DL_` prefix).
- **Conclusion:** `local-dev` version is correct and intentional. Keep as-is.

### Next Steps

- All branches should be updated to include this version of DL_CraftingEnhancedCore.
