### DL_CraftingEnhancedCore

- Reviewed against `steam_release` version.
- **Result:** Identical content except for `mod.info`.
- **Difference:**
  - `name=` and `id=` were renamed in `local-dev` to use new naming convention (`DL_` prefix).
- **Conclusion:** `local-dev` version is correct and intentional. Keep as-is.
